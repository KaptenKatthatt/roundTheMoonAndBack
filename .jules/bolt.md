## 2024-05-16 - R3F Zustand Subscription Performance
**Learning:** In React Three Fiber, components subscribing directly to a rapidly changing Zustand state (like `currentTime` at 60fps) within the component body will cause expensive React re-renders on every frame.
**Action:** Always read high-frequency state using `useStore.getState()` inside a `useFrame` loop instead of a standard React hook subscription. If a React component must react to high-frequency state for things like `useMemo` dependency arrays, throttle the subscription by returning a rounded value (e.g. `Math.floor(s.currentTime / INTERVAL) * INTERVAL`).
